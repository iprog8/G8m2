        Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.[2] Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, Indian subcontinent, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are C. arabica and C. robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.

Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world,[4] and it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative. <br>

        You need a good quality Espresso making machine to extract the correct shot
Your water temperature should be set to approximately 198 degrees Fahrenheit
Do always check your coffee beans or coffee grounds for the correct temperature range for your blend, as some differ
If you use ground coffee for your Espresso, you need between 6.5 and 7.5g for 30ml of Espresso
You must always tamp your coffee grinds first, so place your grounds into your tamping machine (filter holder) and allow it to apply the correct pressure
Your pump pressure should be set between 8 and 9 Bar during extraction. Bear in mind that different machines have different groups. If you have more than one group, set your pressure at 8 Bar during extraction
Extraction should take from 20 to 30 seconds (the exact time varies according to your machine and your chosen coffee grounds); you’ll understand the right extraction time after you’ve made a few cups of Espresso. However, you can also alter your size of grounds
Warm your Espresso cup (if you pour your Espresso into a cold cup it will instantly cool)
Some machines have automatic cup warmers but if yours doesn’t, swirl boiling hot water inside the cup for a few seconds and pour out
Once ready, allow the Espresso to drop into your cup or pour it in depending on your machine<br>
