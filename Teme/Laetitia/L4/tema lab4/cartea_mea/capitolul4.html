        <p>Most DITA topic semantic elements can be categorised as block or phrase elements.

            Block elements are paragraph-like elements that are typically displayed in the output with space above and below the content, taking up the full width of the available space. Phrase (or inline) elements are applied to words or phrases within a block element, and typically do not force new lines in the output.
            
            Block elements can exist within other block elements, but not within phrase elements.
            
            Phrase elements can exist within block elements and within other phrase elements.</p>

            Examples of block elements include:

            <ul>
            <li>p (paragraph)</li>
            <li>codeblock</li>
            <li>steps</li>
            <li>msgblock</li>
            <li>title</li></ul>

            Examples of phrase elements include:

            <ul><li>term</li>
                <li>codeph</li>
                <li>uicontrol</li>
                <li>msgph</li>
                <li>tm (trademark)</li></ul>

        <h2 id="sc2"><a href="#sc2">4.2 DITA Task</a></h2>
        
        The task topic is one of the three base DITA information types.<br>
        
        Task topics are used to document the steps of a particular task or procedure, or to document the stages within a high level process. Task topics are the building blocks for task-oriented documentation. Task topics are more strictly structured than concept and reference topics.
        <br>
        Task topics address the question of "how to?".
        <br>
        The root element of a task topic is task.

        
        <h3>General Task</h3>
        The general task information type was introduced in DITA 1.2 as a less prescriptive alternative to the task (or strict task) information type.

        <h2 id="sc3"><a href="#sc3">4.3 DITA Concept</a></h2>
        <p>The concept topic is one of the three base DITA information types.

        Concept topics are used to document conceptual or overview information. They contain background information that users must know before they can successfully work with a product or within a process. Concepts can be broken into sections, but they are primarily comprised of simple paragraphs and unordered lists.
            
        Concept topics answer the question "what is?".
            
        The root element of a concept topic is concept.</p>

        <h2 id="sc4"><a href="#sc4">4.4 DITA Reference</a></h2>
        The reference topic is one of the three base DITA information types.

        Reference topics are used to describe features of sets of things, such as codes, types and commands. Information that normally demands tabular presentation probably belongs in reference topics. Catalogues, directories and bibliographies are good examples of reference topic information. Reference topics are often organised into tables.
        
        Reference topics contains "facts without explanation".
        
        The root element of a reference topic is reference.

        <p>DITA is technically defined as an XML application, and is therefore built on XML language standards. XML itself is based on other character representation rules. DITA can also be used in conjunction with related standards and technologies.</p><br>
