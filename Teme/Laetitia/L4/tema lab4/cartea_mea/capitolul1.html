        <p>DITA is often compared to the Lego system. Just as you can use Lego bricks to build the most varied replicas of the real world, you can use DITA topics to create any information products necessary.</p>

        <h3>Punctuation in lists</h3>
        
        <p>Ordered and unordered list items should have no terminating punctuation marks, such as commas, semicolons, and full stops, except when all items in a list are complete sentences. This approach maximises re-usability.</p>

        <p>Punctuation in lists is already a contentious issue, but content re-use with conditional publishing in DITA makes it a little more so.</p>

        <p>Punctuation options for ordered and unordered lists include:</p><br>
  <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>comma terminators for all items except the last, which has a full stop</li>
  <li>no terminators except for the last, which has a full stop</li>
  <li>Some conventions include the word "and" at the end of the second last item.</li>
</ul style>

Writing in a DITA environment, the context is removed from the content. This means that a list in the DITA source may not appear in the same sequence in the output. Some items might be removed by conditional publishing; for example, items relating to the administrator audience might be omitted from an output intended for novice users.

Because the second last item and the last item cannot be always identified, it is counter-productive to add "and" or different punctuation (eg, a full stop) at that point. (In other words, the second last and last items can't be treated as exceptions.)

List items should therefore have no closing punctuation, to maximise re-usability. An exception to this guideline is in the case of a list where all items are complete sentences.

In other cases, if considered necessary, a full stop can be added to the end of a list by the publishing process. For this approach to work, it is vital that all lists, including those with complete sentences, have no terminators.

<h2>Types of lists</h2>

There are four semantically-distinct general purpose list types in DITA, each of which is typically rendered differently in the output.

<ol>
  <li>Simple Lists</li>
  <li>Bulleted (unordered) Lists</li>
  <li>Numbered (ordered) Lists</li>
  <li>Definition Lists</li>
</ol>

        <h2 id="sc2"><a href="#sc2">1.2. What Makes DITA so Special</a></h2>
        <p>DITA is an XML standard, an architectural approach, and a writing methodology, developed by technical communicators for technical communicators.
        DITA stands for the Darwin Information Typing Architecture.
        The "Darwin" is in homage to Charles Darwin, the famed scientist credited with the theory of evolution following the publication of his On the Origin of Species. DITA incorporates principles of specialisation, adaption and inheritance that are reminiscent of Darwinian theory (only in a completely different field!).</p>

        <h2 id="sc3"><a href="#sc3">1.3 What Comes Free of Charge with DITA</a></h2>
        <p>As more companies implement DITA to streamline the development of technical content, the demand for DITA-literate technical communicators is growing. The DITA Style Guide provides comprehensive, practical explanations of DITA elements and attributes. Real-world examples and clear recommendations show you how to create consistent, semantically-correct DITA content.

          The <i>"DITA Style Guide: Best Practices for Authors is designed to help DITA authors"</i> implement DITA consistently by providing an authoritative reference (in the same way that The Chicago Manual of Style provides a reference for matters of language, writing and presentational style).
          
          Some rules and recommendations may be controversial or contentious, and you may not agree with them. However, the purpose of The DITA Style Guide is to make a "ruling" one way or the other, so that at least a consistent approach can be adopted.</p>

        <h2 id="sc4"><a href="#sc4">1.4. DITA History</a></h2>
        <p>The DITA Style Guide is written for the DITA base content model, and not for specialisations. (The nature of specialisation would make it impossible to write usage rules!)

          The DITA Style Guide is not an exhaustive set of rules or guidelines; it addresses the most common questions that DITA users ask, based on analysis of the Yahoo! DITA Users Group mailing list.
          
          The DITA Style Guide is not authoring-tool specific, so by necessity it uses neutral code examples, rather than examples of what might appear in a WYSIOO editor, or other tool-specific interactions. There are many practical examples, most built around a fictitious car manual.
          
          Style guides are often arranged alphabetically, but The DITA Style Guide is arranged into nine chapters covering different aspects of DITA mark-up. It is intended to be referenced, rather than read (it's not a "good read"), so the index is comprehensive.</p>
