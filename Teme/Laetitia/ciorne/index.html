        <p class="p">JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.

            The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run
            automatically as the page loads.

            Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.

        <p>Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server,
            or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.</p>

    <div class="div-3">This div element has a top margin of 100px, a right margin of 150px, a bottom margin of 100px,
        and a left
        margin of 80px.</div>
