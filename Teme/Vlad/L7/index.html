            Hiroo Onoda was born on March 19, 1922, in the village of Kamekawa in the Wakayama prefecture of Japan. “I was always defiant and stubborn in everything I did,” Onoda later said of his childhood.

            He was also one in a long line of warriors, dating all the way back to his samurai ancestors and continuing up to his father, a sergeant in the Japanese cavalry who fought and died in the Second Sino-Japanese War in China.
            Hiroo Onoda is a Japanese citizen that originally worked at a Chinese trading company.When he was 20 years old,
            he was called to join the Japanese army.  He promptly quit his job and headed off to training in Japan. 
            At a certain point in his training, he was chosen to be trained at Nakano School as an Imperial Army Intelligence 
            Officer. In this specialized military intelligence training, he was specifically taught methods of gathering intelligence
            and how to conduct guerrilla warfare. 
            He was being groomed to go in behind enemy lines and be left with small pockets of soldiers to make life miserable 
            for Japan’s enemies and gather intelligence in the process.
        
            On December 26th, 1944, Onoda was sent to Lubang Island in the Philippines.His orders from his commanding officers, Major Yoshimi Taniguchi, were simple:<br>
            <i>"You are absolutely forbidden to die by your own hand. It may take three years, it may take five, but whatever happens,
             we’ll come back for you. Until then, so long as you have one soldier, you are to continue to lead him. You may have to live on coconuts. If that’s the case,
             live on coconuts! Under no circumstances are you [to] give up your life voluntarily."</i>

            When he landed on the island, Onoda joined forces with a group of Japanese soldiers who had been sent there 
            previously. The officers in the group outranked Onoda and prevented him from carrying out his assignment, which 
            made it easier for United States and Philippine Commonwealth forces to take the island when they landed on 28 February 1945. 
            Within a short time of the landing, all but Onoda and three other soldiers had either died or surrendered. 
            Onoda, who had been promoted to lieutenant, ordered the men to take to the hills.

            Onoda continued his campaign as a Japanese holdout, initially living in the mountains with three fellow soldiers (Private Yūichi Akatsu, Corporal Shōichi Shimada and Private First Class Kinshichi Kozuka).During his stay, Onoda and his companions carried out guerrilla activities and engaged in several shootouts with the police.
            The first time they saw a leaflet announcing that Japan had surrendered was in October 1945; another cell had killed a cow 
            and found a leaflet left behind by islanders which read: "The war ended on August 15. Come down from the mountains!"However, they distrusted the leaflet. 
            They concluded that the leaflet was Allied propaganda, and also believed that they would not have been fired on if the war had indeed been over. Toward the end of 1945, leaflets were dropped by air with a surrender order printed on them from General Tomoyuki Yamashita of the Fourteenth Area Army. They had been in hiding for over a year, and this leaflet was the only evidence they had the war was over.
            Onoda's group studied the leaflet closely to determine whether it was genuine, and decided it was not.
            One of the four, Yuichi Akatsu walked away from the others in September 1949 and surrendered to Filipino forces in 1950 after six months on his own. This seemed like a security problem to the others and they became even more cautious. In 1952 letters and family pictures were dropped from aircraft urging them to surrender, but the three soldiers concluded that this was a trick. Shimada was shot in the leg during a shoot-out with local fishermen in June 1953, after which Onoda nursed him back to health. On May 7th 1954, Shimada was killed by a shot fired by a search party looking for the men. Kozuka was killed by two shots fired by local police on 19 October 1972,[7] when he and Onoda, as part of their guerrilla activities, were burning rice that had been collected by farmers. 
            Onoda was now alone.

            On 20 February 1974, Onoda met a Japanese man, Norio Suzuki, who was traveling around the world, looking for "Lieutenant Onoda,
            a panda, and the Abominable Snowman, in that order" Suzuki found Onoda after four days of searching.
            Onoda described this moment in a 2010 interview: "This hippie boy Suzuki came to the island to listen to the feelings of a Japanese soldier. Suzuki asked me why I would not come out ..." Onoda and Suzuki became friends, but Onoda still refused to surrender, saying that he was waiting for orders from a superior officer. Suzuki returned to Japan with photographs of himself and Onoda as proof of their encounter, and the Japanese government located Onoda's commanding officer,
            Major Yoshimi Taniguchi, who had since become a bookseller. Taniguchi flew to Lubang, and on 9 March 1974,
            he finally met with Onoda and fulfilled a promise he had made back in 1944: "Whatever happens, we'll come back for you"
            Taniguchi then issued Onoda the following orders:
            </p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>In accordance with the Imperial command, the Fourteenth Area Army has ceased all combat activity.</li>
                <li>In accordance with military Headquarters Command No. A-2003, the Special Squadron of Staff's Headquarters is relieved of all military duties.</li>
                <li>Units and individuals under the command of Special Squadron are to cease military activities and operations immediately and place themselves under the command of the nearest superior officer. When no officer can be found, they are to communicate with the American or Philippine forces and follow their directives.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

    <div class="last-paragraphs">
        <p id="fifth">Onoda was thus properly relieved of duty, and he surrendered. He turned over his sword, his functioning Arisaka Type 99 rifle, 500 rounds of ammunition and several hand grenades, as well as the dagger his mother had given him in 1944 to kill himself with if he was captured. Only Private Teruo Nakamura, arrested on 18 December 1974 in Indonesia, held out for longer.</p>
        <p id="sixth">Although he had killed people and engaged in shootouts with the police, the circumstances (namely, that he believed that the war was still ongoing) were taken into consideration, and Onoda received a pardon from President Ferdinand Marcos.</p>
        <p id="seventh">Onoda revisited Lubang Island in 1996, donating US$10,000 for the local school on Lubang. His wife, Machie Onoda, became the head of the conservative Japan Women's Association in 2006.</p>
