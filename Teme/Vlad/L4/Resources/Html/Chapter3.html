            <h3>1775-1783</h3><br>
            After many years of producing their own whiskey, and seeing its value to the general population,
            distillers often used whiskey as a currency during the American Revolutionary War.<br>
            <h3>1783</h3>
            The first commercial distillery is founded in Louisville, Kentucky on the banks of the Ohio River by Evan Williams.
            <h3>1793</h3>
            A new excise was introduced to help fund debt from the Revolutionary War. Import duties were already high, and so an excise tax on domestically produced distilled spirits was levied – the first of it’s kind by the new national government. Although the tax applied to distilled spirits of any kind, whiskey was the most popular,
            and so the excise became commonly known as the “Whiskey Tax.”<br>
            <h3>1791-1794</h3>
            The ensuing unrest between grain farmers and the US government was soon dubbed the “Whiskey Rebellion“.
            Farmers were used to distilling their surplus grains into whiskey and a united protest gathered speed,
            particularly in the western counties of Pennsylvania where federal officials were intimidated in order
            to deny collection of the tax.<br>
            The rebellion came to a turning point in July 1794 when the home of tax inspector General John Neville
            was attacked by nearly 600 armed men. President Washington responded by sending in a militia force of 
            around 13,000 to march west and meet any resistance with force. The rebels disbanded before their arrival,
            key leaders fled to safety, and the mass protesting came to an end.<br>
            <h3>1820</h3>
            A certain Scottish grocer named John Walker began producing his own whisky, which 
            would become one of the most famous and most widely distributed brands of Scotch whisky in the world.
            John Walker himself, was a teetotaler.<br>
            <h3>1823</h3>
            The United Kingdom brought “moonshine” production to an end, when they gave Scottish distilleries an 
            option to legalize their operations by paying a fee.

            <h3>1823</h3>
            The process that is sour mash was developed by Dr. James C. Crow at what is now the Woodford Reserve Distillery in Kentucky.
            In the process, an amount of spent mash is added to a new mash, and the balance of acid and live yeast that is contained controls
            the growth of foreign bacteria, improving consistency between batches so that every bottle is as close to the previous as possible.
            This revolutionized the way in which bourbon is made, and is also a current legal requirement when producing Tennessee whiskey.<br>
            <h3>1840</h3>
            Old Bourbon County had been producing “Old Bourbon County Whiskey” for some years; the name was used to differentiate it from other whiskeys
            because Old Bourbon was the first corn whiskey that most people had come across. It wasn’t until 1840 that it was officially given the name Bourbon,
            when a distiller by the name of Jacob Spears was the first to label his product as “Bourbon whiskey.“<br>
            <h3>1850</h3>
            The first blended whisky comes into production. Andrew Usher mixed traditional pot still whiskey with that of a new batch produced
            in a Coffey still. Usher met stubborn resistance from traditional Irish distillers, many of whom claimed that this new blend was 
            not whisky at all. Still, his company became the first to produce and mass-market a bottled blended scotch, and even became a popular
            import in the U.S. after finding distribution with Nicholas & Co. in 1853.<br>

            <h2 id="Prohibition">Prohibition Era</h2>
            <h3>1920-1933</h3>
            For 13 years, the American Prohibition era banned all production, sale, and use of alcohol.
             However, the federal government made an exception: the prescription of medicinal whiskey from a doctor, to be sold through a licensed pharmacy.
            (During this same timeframe, the pharmacy chain Walgreens used this to their advantage, growing from 20 stores to nearly 400.)
