            <h3 id=Scotch>Scotch whisky</h3>
            Whisky made in Scotland is known as Scotch whisky, or simply as "Scotch" (especially in North America).
            <h4>The regions of Scotch whisky<br><br>
            Scotch whiskies are generally distilled twice, although some are distilled a third time and others even up to twenty times.
            Scotch Whisky Regulations require anything bearing the label "Scotch" to be distilled in Scotland and matured for a minimum of
            three years in oak casks, among other, more specific criteria.Any age statement on the bottle, in the form of a number, must reflect
            the age of the youngest Scotch whisky used to produce that product. A whisky with an age statement is known as guaranteed age whisky.
            Scotch whisky without an age statement may, by law, be as young as three years old.
            The basic types of Scotch are malt and grain, which are combined to create blends. Scotch malt whiskies were divided into five main regions: 
            Highland, Lowland, Islay, Speyside and Campbeltown.
            There is also a sixth region recognized by some sources, though not by the Scotch Whisky Association,The Islands, excluding Islay.
            This unofficial region, (part of the Highlands according to the Association), includes the following whisky-producing islands making Island
            single malt: Arran, Jura, Mull, Orkney, and Skye: with their respective distilleries: Arran, Jura, Tobermory, Highland Park, Scapa and Talisker.
            <h3 id=Irish>Irish Whiskey</h3><br>
            Irish whiskeys are normally distilled three times, Cooley Distillery being the exception as they also double distill.
            Though traditionally distilled using pot stills, the column still is now used to produce grain whiskey for blends. By law,
            Irish whiskey must be produced in Ireland and aged in wooden casks for a period of no less than three years,
            although in practice it is usually three or four times that period.Unpeated malt is almost always used,
            the main exception being Connemara Peated Malt whiskey. There are several types of whiskey common to Ireland:
            single malt, single grain, blended whiskey and pure pot still whiskey.
            rish whiskey was once the most popular spirit in the world, though a long period of decline from the late 19th century to the 
            late 20th century greatly damaged the industry,so much so that, although Ireland boasted over 30 distilleries in the 1890s,
            a century later this number had fallen to just three. However, Irish whiskey has seen a great resurgence in popularity since 
            the late twentieth century, and has been the fastest growing spirit in the world every year since 1990.<br>
            <h3 id=Bourbon>American Bourbon Whiskey</h3><br>
            Bourbon has been distilled since the 18th century. The name "Bourbon" was not applied until the 1850s,
            and the Kentucky etymology was not advanced until the 1870s. Although bourbon may be made anywhere in the United States,
            it is strongly associated with the American South and with Kentucky in particular. As of 2014, distillers' wholesale market
            revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. was about $2.7 billion, and bourbon made up about two-thirds of the $1.6 billion
            of U.S. exports of distilled spirits.According to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, U.S. distillers
            derived $3.6 billion in revenue from bourbon and Tennessee whiskey
            (a closely related spirit produced in the state of Tennessee) sold in the United States.<br>
            <h3 id=Canadian>Canadian whiskey</h3>
            By Canadian law, Canadian whiskies must be produced and aged in Canada, be distilled from a fermented mash of cereal grain,
            be aged in wood barrels with a capacity limit of 700 litres (185 US gal; 154 imp gal) for not less than three years,
            and "possess the aroma, taste and character generally attributed to Canadian whisky".The terms "Canadian Whisky",
            "Rye Whisky", and "Canadian Rye Whisky" are legally indistinguishable in Canada and do not require any specific grain in their
            production and are often blends of two or more grains. Canadian whiskies may contain caramel and flavouring in addition to the
            distilled mash spirits, and there is no maximum limit on the alcohol level of the distillation.The minimum bottling proof is 40% ABV.
            To be exported under one of the "Canadian Whisky" designations, a whisky cannot contain more than 9.09% imported spirits.<br>
            <h3 id=Japanese>Japanese whiskey</h3>
            apan produces both single malt and blended whiskies. The base is a mash of malted barley, dried in kilns fired with a little peat
            (although less than what is used for some peated Scotch whiskies), and is distilled using the pot still method.
            Before 2000, Japanese whisky was primarily for the domestic market and exports were limited. Japanese whiskies such as 
            Suntory and Nikka won many prestigious international awards between 2007 and 2014. Japanese whisky has earned a reputation for quality.<br>
