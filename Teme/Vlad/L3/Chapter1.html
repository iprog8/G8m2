            <article>The principals for the distillation of whisky have changed little over the last 200 years.<br>
            Just three basic ingredients are needed - water, barley and yeast. Technology now aids production,<br>
            but traditionally there are five stages to the process - malting, mashing, fermentation, distillation and maturation.<br>
            Here we go through and explain each of these important stages.

            <h2 id="Malting">Step 1 - Malting</h2><br>
            Barley contains starch and it is this starch which needs to be converted into <br>
            soluble sugars to make alcohol. For this to occur, the barley must undergo germination and this first part of <br>
            the prodess is called 'malting'. Each distiller has their own preference about the type of barley they buy,<br>
            but they need a type that produce high yields of soluble sugar. The barley is soaked for 2-3 days in warm<br>
            water and then traditionally spread on the floor of a building called a malting house. It is turned regularly<br>
            to maintain a constant temperature. This is also carried out on a commercial scale in large drums which rotate.<br>

            <h2 id="Mashing">Step 2 - Mashing</h2><br>
            The ground down malt, which is called 'grist', is now added to warm water to begin<br> 
            the extraction of the soluble sugars. The water is normally from a pure, reliable,<br>
            local source - this is why most distilleries around the world are next to a river or lake.<br>
            The character of this water can influence the final spirit as it can contain minerals from passing over or <br>
            though granite, peat or other rock. The liquid combination of malt and water is called the 'mash'.<br> 
            It is put into a large vessel called a mash tun and stirred for several hours.<br>

            <h2 id="Fermentation">Step 3 - Fermentation</h2><br>
            The wort is cooled and passed into large tanks called washbacks.<br>
            These are traditionally made of wood, but now a number of distilleries use stainless steel.<br>
            Here the yeast is added and the fermentation begins. The yeast turns the sugars that are present into alcohol. <br>
            As with the barley and water, the distiller will carefully select the strain of yeast that they use and it <br>
            can also have a small effect on the final flavour of the spirit. The fermentation normally takes around 48<br>
            hours to run its natural course, although some distilleries will let it go for longer so as to create further<br>
            characteristics that they require. The liquid at this stage is called 'wash' and is low in alcohol strength<br>
            (between 5-10% ABV), like beer or ale. You could make beer from the liquid at this point, but the difference<br>
            with whisky is that the liquid is now distilled rather than brewed.<br>

            <h2 id="Distillation">Step 4 - Distillation</h2><br>
            In Scotland, the wash is traditionally distilled twice. In Ireland, it is distilled three times although there are exceptions<br>
            in both countries. Here is a brief explanation of the double distillation process. The stills are made from copper, which <br>
            has been found to be the best material for extracting impurities from the spirit as it is being distilled, and consist of a <br>
            bowl shape at the bottom that rises up to the neck at the top. All are the same in principal, but a different shape will <br>
            give a different flavour and character to the final spirit. Taller stills with longer necks will give finer, lighter spirits <br>
            while shorter, fatter stills will produce a fuller, richer spirit.

            <h2 id="Maturation">Step 5 - Maturation</h2><br>
            The spirit is put into oak casks and stored. The most common types of oak casks are those that have previously<br>
            been used in the American bourbon and Spanish sherry industries. The spirit must mature in casks for a minimum of<br>
            three years before it is legally allowed to be called whisky in Scotland. During maturation, the flavours of the<br>
            spirit combine with natural compounds in the wood cask and this gives the whisky its own characteristic flavour and aroma.<br>
